# PyBer Ride-Sharing Analysis

## Analysis Overview

V. Isualize, CEO of PyBer, has requested from her data analysts a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. A graph was also created to show the total weekly fares for each city type. We will summarize below how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used to guide decision-makers at PyBer. A total of three recommendations will be made based on the data analysis below.

## Results
As the summary DataFrame that was created for Deliverable 1 shows, there is quite a wide spectrum across the ride-sharing data. [Resources/Pyber_summary_df.png] 

- Total Rides are least in Rural city types, with 125 total rides; suburban is next, with 625 rides; and urban city types have the highest number of rides at 1,625. 

- Total driver numbers also reflect this general pattern, with smallest number of total drivers in rural cities at 78, then suburban cities with 490, and urban cities with 2,405 total drivers. 

- Total fares progress from $4,237.93 in rural cities, $19,356.33 in suburban cities, and $39,854.38 in urban cities. 

- Average fares reflect the scarcity of ride shares in rural areas and the concentration in urban cities; the average fare per ride is highest in rural cities, at $34.62 and lowest in urban cities, at $24.53. Suburban cities are roughly in between at $30.97. 

- Finally, the average fare per driver follows the same pattern as average fare per ride. Fares per driver are highest in rural areas, with an average fare earned of $55.49, a bit less in suburban areas with an average fare per driver of $39.50, and a paltry $16.57 by comparison average fare per driver in urban cities. 

## Summary

It can be stated that based on the data presented here, urban city types bring in the highest total fares, with suburban cities running a distant second, and rural cities an even more distant third. [Resources/PyBer_fare_summary_png.png]  

### Recommendation One

Though rural cities do not make up a large portion of total fares, drivers in these cities do earn a higher average fare per ride than the other two types of cities. One recommendation based on this data analysis is for PyBer to work to recruit more drivers in this region. 

### Recommendation Two 

Relatedly, a second recommendation would be to market and advertise more for riders in rural areas, particularly for sporting events or concerts in neighboring suburban or urban areas. There is high potential to grow the business in rural areas. 

### Recommendation Three 

Finally, a third recommendation is to make similar outreach efforts in suburban areas, as there is also room in these cities to grow the business. Urban cities do appear to be fairly saturated with drivers and riders, and there may be less room for distinction and growth in these city types.
